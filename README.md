# EasyWeb Project
Live DEMO: [Link](https://app.netlify.com/teams/timklancisar/overview)
This is initial version of the project's README file.<br>
As developers, we know how time consuming setting up a new project can be, the aim of our project is to create a tool that would simplify this process for you.

## - VISION STATEMENT -
### Problem statement:
A tool for creating html/css templates
### Target users:
Web developers
### Use Cases:
  - Template layout custumization with draggable components.
  - Option to add, remove, duplicate or customise specific components.
  - Option to choose a color theme.
  - Option to export html/css of a finished template.

## - FILE STRUCTURE - 
For now we should only concerne ourselves with the contents of the 'src' folder. I've took the liberty to create couple of subfolders.<br>
 - Pages (All react-router endpoints)
 - PageElements (Sections of the main pages)
 - components (Reusable components)
 - assets (Media)
 - features (Additional JS logic)
